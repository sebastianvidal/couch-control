Trackpad & keyboard for Mac/PC

Gaming on a Mac plugged into the TV? Leave the mouse and keyboard on the desk. Couchpad turns your iPhone into both, over Wi‑Fi, with nothing to sign up for.

## Description [4000]

Couchpad turns your iPhone into a trackpad and keyboard for your Mac or Windows PC.

It was made for one situation: the computer is plugged into the TV, you're on the couch across the room, and you don't want a mouse and keyboard on your lap. Open Couchpad, and your phone is both.

HOW IT WORKS
Install the free companion app on your computer (couchpad site, link below). Couchpad finds it on your Wi‑Fi by itself. Pair once by scanning the QR code it shows, and you're in. Everything stays on your local network: no account, no servers, no cloud.

TRACKPAD
• One finger moves the pointer, tap to click, two-finger tap to right-click
• Two fingers scroll, tap-then-hold to drag
• Three-finger swipes open Mission Control, App Exposé and switch Spaces
• Left and right mouse buttons you can hold while you move
• Pointer and scroll speed, natural scrolling and tap-to-drag are adjustable

KEYBOARD
• The regular iPhone keyboard, typing straight to the computer
• A strip above it with the keys a phone doesn't have: esc, tab, arrows, ⌘, ⌥, ⌃, ⇧ and F1–F12
• Modifiers toggle and stay held, so ⌘C, ⌥Tab and friends just work
• Hold-to-press keys for games: WASD, space and more stay down while your finger does

BUILT FOR GAMES
Pointer movement is sent as raw mouse motion, which is what games use for camera look, and keys are sent as real presses that stay held. Menus, strategy, point-and-click, launchers, Steam Big Picture: all from the couch.

PRIVATE BY DESIGN
Couchpad collects no data. It asks for Local Network access to find your computer and for the camera only when you scan a pairing code. Only phones you've paired can send input, and you can forget a phone from the computer at any time.

OPEN SOURCE
The whole thing, including the Mac and Windows apps, is MIT-licensed on GitHub.

REQUIREMENTS
A Mac (macOS 13 or later) or a Windows 10/11 PC running the free Couchpad companion app, on the same Wi‑Fi network as your iPhone. Get it at https://sebastianvidal.github.io/couchpad/

## App Review notes

Couchpad is a trackpad/keyboard remote for the user's own computer on the local network, in the same category as Remote Mouse, Mobile Mouse and Unified Remote (App Store Review Guideline 4.2.7, remote desktop clients for user-owned computers on a local network).

Like those apps, it needs a free companion on the computer, because macOS requires Accessibility permission on the Mac itself to inject input; that cannot be done from an iPhone alone and the companion cannot be distributed through the Mac App Store (sandbox). The companion is free, open source and linked from the app's first-run screen: https://sebastianvidal.github.io/couchpad/

To test:
1. On a Mac on the same Wi‑Fi as the test iPhone, download and open the companion from the link above and grant Accessibility when asked.
2. Open Couchpad on the iPhone. It finds the Mac automatically and shows a pairing screen.
3. Click the cursor icon in the Mac's menu bar → "Pairing code" and scan the QR with the Scan button (or type the 6 digits).
4. Move a finger on the trackpad area: the Mac pointer moves. Type on the keyboard: text appears on the Mac.

Without a companion, the app still launches and offers the setup guide and gesture reference; it cannot do more by nature, as with the other apps in this category.

No account, no login, no data collection. The Local Network permission is used only for Bonjour discovery and the direct connection; the camera only for the pairing QR.

## TestFlight — Beta App Description

Couchpad turns your iPhone into a trackpad and keyboard for your Mac or Windows PC over Wi‑Fi — made for a computer plugged into the TV and you on the couch.

You'll need the free companion app on the computer, from https://sebastianvidal.github.io/couchpad/. Open it, grant Accessibility on the Mac (or allow it through the firewall on Windows), then open Couchpad on your phone: it finds the computer by itself. Pair once by scanning the QR code from the computer's menu-bar or tray icon.

Everything stays on your local network. No account, no data collected.

## TestFlight — What to Test (build 1)

• Pairing: does the phone find your computer without typing anything? Does the QR scan work first try?
• Trackpad feel: pointer speed, tap-to-click, two-finger scroll, tap-then-hold drag. Adjust in Settings (gear) if it's off and tell me what you changed.
• Keyboard: type a sentence into any app. Try ⌘ + letter shortcuts using the strip above the keyboard.
• Three-finger swipe up for Mission Control.
• Leave the app, come back: it should reconnect within a couple of seconds without asking for the code again.
• Games: use the "F-keys & hold keys" strip for WASD; tell me which games worked and which didn't.

## Screenshots

`docs/screenshots/01…05.png`, 1320×2868 (6.9" iPhone). Upload in that order to the 6.9"
slot in App Store Connect; it reuses them for the smaller sizes. Regenerate with
`python3 Tools/compose-screenshots.py <folder of raw simulator captures> docs/screenshots`
(raw captures: `xcrun simctl io 'iPhone 16 Pro Max' screenshot name.png`).

## Export compliance

`ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption = NO` and no App Encryption Documentation upload. Reason: all
cryptography is Apple's own (CryptoKit: P-256 key agreement, HKDF-SHA256, AES-256-GCM,
HMAC-SHA256), used to encrypt a local-network connection; no proprietary or third-party
cipher code ships in the app. That is the "encryption within Apple's operating system"
category, which is exempt. Revisit if a crypto library is ever vendored into the iOS app.
