# Couchpad

Your iPhone as a trackpad and keyboard for your Mac or Windows PC, over local Wi-Fi. Made
for gaming on a computer plugged into the TV without a mouse and keyboard on the couch.

No accounts, no cloud: the phone finds the computer with Bonjour, pairs once with a 6-digit
code or QR, and talks to it over one encrypted TCP connection on your network.

**Status (October 2026)**
- **iPhone:** public **TestFlight beta** — https://testflight.apple.com/join/kY67K51G — ahead
  of a free App Store release.
- **Mac:** **1.1 released**, signed and notarized —
  [download](https://github.com/sebastianvidal/couchpad/releases/latest). 1.1 brings encrypted
  sessions and hardened pairing; it needs the current iPhone build.
- **Windows:** compiles, not yet run on a real Windows machine (see the appendix).

## Get started

1. **iPhone:** install [TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/app/testflight/id899247664), then
   open https://testflight.apple.com/join/kY67K51G on the phone and tap Install. Allow
   **Local Network** when asked, otherwise the app can't find your computer.
2. **Mac:** download `Couchpad-1.1.dmg` from
   [Releases](https://github.com/sebastianvidal/couchpad/releases/latest), drag Couchpad to
   Applications, open it. A cursor icon appears in the menu bar. Grant **Accessibility** when
   macOS asks (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility); that permission is what
   lets it move the pointer and type.
3. **Pair:** on the same Wi-Fi, open Couchpad on the phone. It finds the Mac; click the
   menu-bar icon → "Pair an iPhone…" and scan the QR (or type the 6 digits). Done — the phone
   keeps a token and never asks again.

Mac menu: connection status · Pair an iPhone… · address · Accessibility state · Launch at
Login · Forget Paired iPhones. If Bonjour is blocked on your network, the QR pairing also
carries the Mac's address, or type it into Settings → Connection on the phone.

## Gestures

| Phone                      | Computer                                 |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| One finger                 | Move pointer                             |
| Tap                        | Left click                               |
| Two-finger tap             | Right click                              |
| Two fingers                | Scroll                                   |
| Tap, then touch and hold   | Drag (release to drop)                   |
| Three-finger swipe         | Up: Mission Control · Down: App Exposé · Left/right: switch Spaces (Windows: Task View / desktop / virtual desktops) |
| Left / Right buttons       | Hold the mouse button                    |
| iOS keyboard               | Typing, backspace, return as real key presses |
| esc, tab, arrows, F-keys, WASD strip | Key down while touched, up on release |
| ⇧ ⌃ ⌥ ⌘ fn                 | Toggle: held until tapped again; typed letters become shortcuts (⌘C etc.) |
| On a Windows host          | The same keys show as Ctrl / Alt / Win; fn is hidden |
| Keyboard button            | Hide / show the iOS keyboard to enlarge the trackpad |

Pointer speed, scroll speed, natural scrolling, tap-to-drag and three-finger swipes are in
the gear menu.

## Pairing

The first time a phone connects, it asks for a 6-digit code. "Pair an iPhone…" in the
host's menu-bar or tray icon opens a window with a **QR code** and the digits: scan it with
the Scan button in the app (or with the iPhone's Camera app, which opens Couchpad), or type
the digits. The host then gives the phone a token it keeps, so the code is never needed again
for that phone. Only phones with a token can send input.

The code is only live while that window is open, for at most one minute, and for one pairing.
Each connection gets a single guess; three wrong guesses rotate the code and pause pairing for
a few seconds. Pairing is the only way in: without a token, the host ignores everything.

The QR carries the host's address (`couchpad://pair?name=…&addr=…&port=…&code=…`), so a QR
pairing also works on networks that block Bonjour; the phone remembers the address and falls
back to it when discovery finds nothing.

## Security

Everything stays on your local network; the design assumes other people may be on it too.

- **Encrypted sessions.** Every connection starts with an ephemeral P-256 key exchange; the
  session key comes from HKDF and every line after that is AES-256-GCM. An eavesdropper sees
  two public keys and a nonce, then ciphertext.
- **Nothing secret is ever sent.** The phone proves it holds its token (or the pairing code)
  with an HMAC over the handshake transcript, and the host proves it holds the same token
  back. Captured traffic can't be replayed (fresh keys each time) and an impostor advertising
  your computer's name can neither learn the token nor relay, because the transcript binds
  both sides' keys.
- **Pairing codes are hard to guess.** Live only while the pairing window is open (at most a
  minute, one pairing), one guess per connection, three misses rotate the code and pause
  pairing. Because a new token travels inside the encrypted channel, recording a pairing and
  cracking the 6-digit code afterwards yields nothing; only an attacker active during that
  minute who already knows the code could interpose.
- **What's left:** a paired phone or host that is itself compromised. "Forget Paired
  iPhones" on the host and "Forget this computer" on the phone revoke access.

## Appendix A: Build from source

```
iOS/       Xcode project (SwiftUI). Trackpad on top, the iOS keyboard below, plus the keys it lacks.
Mac/       SwiftPM menu-bar app. Advertises _couchpad._tcp on port 48123, injects CGEvents.
Windows/   .NET 8 tray app. Same protocol and port, injects via SendInput.
Shared/    SecureChannel.swift, the wire protocol, symlinked into the Mac and iOS trees.
Tools/     make-icons.swift renders the app icons.
docs/      The GitHub Pages site and App Store copy.
```

### iPhone

The happy path is TestFlight (above). To run your own build:

1. `cp iOS/Config/Local.xcconfig.example iOS/Config/Local.xcconfig` and put your Team ID in it.
2. Open `iOS/Couchpad.xcodeproj`, pick your iPhone, Run. The build number stamps itself from
   the UTC time of the build.
3. Allow **Local Network** when asked.

### Mac

```bash
Mac/build.sh
open "Mac/build/Couchpad.app"
```

Local builds sign with your Apple Development certificate when one is in the keychain
(so the Accessibility grant survives rebuilds), ad-hoc otherwise.

### Windows

Needs the [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). On Windows:

```bash
dotnet publish Windows -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

Run `Windows/bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/Couchpad.exe`. It lives in the
system tray; right-click for "Pair an iPhone…", the address and "Start with Windows". The
first run asks to allow it through Windows Firewall — allow it on **private** networks, or the
phone can't reach it. No other permission is needed: `SendInput` works for any app, including
games that read raw input (DirectInput / XInput games see the scan codes it sends).

The project also compiles on macOS/Linux (`dotnet build Windows`) for checking changes, but
only runs on Windows.

**Honest note:** the Windows app was written and compile-checked on a Mac, not yet run on a
real Windows machine. If something misbehaves, open an issue.

## Appendix B: Protocol

Protocol v2 (see `Shared/SecureChannel.swift` and `Windows/SecureChannel.cs`):

```
phone → host   v2 <P-256 public key, base64>                      (plain text line)
host  → phone  v2 <P-256 public key, base64> <16-byte nonce, base64>
                → both derive sessionKey = HKDF-SHA256(ECDH, salt: nonce, info: "couchpad v2 session")
                → every message from here is a frame: 4-byte length ‖ AES-256-GCM(line)
phone → host   auth token|code <HMAC-SHA256(secret, transcript ‖ "client")>
host  → phone  ok <token> mac|windows <HMAC-SHA256(token, transcript ‖ "host")>   or   nope (then hangs up)
```

Inside the channel, one command per line:

```
m dx dy      move (dx/dy also sent as raw mouse deltas, which is what games read)
s dx dy      scroll in pixels
b l|r 1|0    mouse button down / up
c l|r        click
k code 1|0   key down / up, macOS virtual keycode
g up|down|left|right   three-finger swipe; the host maps it to its own shortcut
t text       type text (each character is pressed as its key; shift added as needed)
r            release everything
```

The host releases every held key and button when a phone disconnects.

## Appendix C: Releasing

- **iPhone → TestFlight / App Store.** Xcode: Any iOS Device → Product → Archive → Distribute
  → App Store Connect → Upload. The build number is automatic. Listing text and App Review
  notes live in `docs/app-store-copy.md`; the privacy policy URL is the site's
  `privacy.html`. In App Review notes, explain that the Mac app is a free direct download
  (the Mac App Store sandbox forbids input injection) and cite Guideline 4.2.7 and the
  existing apps in this category.
- **Mac → direct download.** Bump `CFBundleShortVersionString` in `Mac/Info.plist`, then
  `SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: …" Mac/release.sh` (see the script for the
  one-time `notarytool` credential setup) and `gh release create v<version> Mac/build/Couchpad-<version>.dmg`.
- **Windows → direct download.** Zip the `publish` folder from the command above and attach
  it to the same release. Unsigned builds trigger SmartScreen's "unknown publisher" warning;
  an Authenticode certificate removes it but isn't required.
